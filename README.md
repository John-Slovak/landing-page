# landing-page

A Odin Project exercise. After finishing up what I believe are the basics of CSS course, I get to make a page up from scratch. A page that should closely resemble a picture given by the odin project. After looking at it for a little bit, and especially after doing the other exercises, I believe I shouldn't have much issues making the site.

UPDATE:
Finished the header, footer, and layed out the general structure. Firstly, the header did take some thinking, but I managed to get it done. Is it the way that it should be? Don't know. I can't wait to dive into other peoples renditions after I'm finished with mine. It looks like what it's supposed to, so I'm happy about that. And secondly, I'm surprised that I found an interesting workflow. One that people probably wouldn't neceserily agree with. I lay out the general html divs, do the html for them, then do the ones withing those, do css for that, do another container, do css etc. I know people say to do all of html first, and then do css. But first of all, I don't know what even goes on the page untill I know the layout and style. And second of all, Bob Ross always paints the sky, then the coulds, then the backround trees, then the mountain over those trees, then the grass on that mountain, then the trees on that mountain, then the cabin, then the rocks, then the lake, then some bushes, and then the foreground grass. My point is, I enjoy going from the back to the front. Changing some div later on is way too difficult if you finish up html first.

UPDATE2:
Site is done. I have "a lot" of divs and css elements. Is that how you are supposed to do it? I take it as making a little control board for every piece on the site. It is somewhat organized, so that's nice. Only issue i ran into is the quote not wanting to stay in the center when i do min-width: 50% for some reason. Anyways, I got a spark of creativity on what to do with it so it isn't just a generic template, that's gonna be the last step.

UPDATE3:
Added links, styled the hover and active functions. Think it's done. Think it turned out great.
